* NeoDeerhunt Code and Information
  Included in this repository is the starter code and helper classes
  that will be run when you submit your code. When you submit your bot
  the contents will be unzipped into a folder with the provided classes.
   
** Submission
   You only need to submit your copy of =grid_player.py= and any new
   files that you created. You do *not* need to submit any of the helper
   classes that are provided to you. Your files should be at the root of
   the zip. You can achieve this by running the following command wherever
   your code is:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     zip submission.zip grid_player.py
   #+END_SRC

   To verify that you've zipped correctly you can either =vim submission.zip=
   and ensure that there is no folder only files or simply unzip your submission
   and confirm that no folders are created.

** Local Testing
   Enclosed is a =run.sh= file. This script automatically will run the server
   as well as both of the clients inside =tmux= (you need =tmux= installed for
   the script to work). You can run the script by typing =./run.sh 8888=. You 
   may need to change the port number if you're running the script frequently.

   The script will open =tmux= launch the server, then make a new tab and launch
   your client twice. You can navigate between the tabs by pressing =C-b n= (control b then n).

   Alternatively you can launch the server and two clients manually in 3 seprate terminals
   by running =./server_runner.py 8888= and =./client_runner.py 8888= respectively.
